            <p> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION</p>

              the copyright owner that is granting the License.</p>

            <p> &quot;Legal Entity&quot; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all<br>
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common<br>
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,<br>
              &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the<br>
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or<br>
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the<br>
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.</p>

              exercising permissions granted by this License.</p>

            <p> &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,<br>
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation<br>
              source, and configuration files.</p>

            <p> &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical<br>
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but<br>
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,<br>
              and conversions to other media types.</p>

            <p> &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or<br>
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a<br>
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work<br>
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).</p>

            <p> &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br>
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br>
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br>
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<br>
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br>
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br>
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.</p>

            <p> &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including<br>
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br>
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally<br>
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner<br>
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<br>
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;<br>
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent<br>
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to<br>
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,<br>
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the<br>
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but<br>
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise<br>
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;</p>

            <p> &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity<br>
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and<br>
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.</p>

            <p> 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br>
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br>
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>

            <p> 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br>
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br>
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br>
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br>
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br>
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>
              as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>

            <p> 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>
              meet the following conditions:</p>

            <p> (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
              Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>

            <p> (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
              stating that You changed the files; and</p>

            <p> (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>
              that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>
              attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
              excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>
              the Derivative Works; and</p>

            <p> (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its<br>
              distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>
              include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
              within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
              pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
              of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>
              as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
              documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>
              within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
              wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
              of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
              do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
              notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>
              or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
              that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
              as modifying the License.</p>

            <p> You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>
              the conditions stated in this License.</p>

            <p> 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>

            <p> 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>

            <p> 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,<br>
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>

            <p> 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

            <p> 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

            <p> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
