# Main-Site

This is the main site deloyed to github pages. 

The best way is to visit https://capitaltwo.ga/, you may use `http-server` if you want to run locally: 

```bash
npm install http-server # install http-server
git clone https://github.com/CapitalTwo/Capstone-Wiki.git
cd Capstone-Wiki
http-server
```

Because of CORS policy and http(non-secure) link, a lot of functions will not work.
